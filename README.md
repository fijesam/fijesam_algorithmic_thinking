# Algorithm to Add Two Decimal Numbers

	Start
	Input a decimal number “A”
	If integer number is entered by User, ask User to repeat input.
	Input decimal number “B”
	If integer number is entered by User, ask User to repeat input.
	Store the output of adding “A” and “B” together as “Sum”
	          Sum = A + B
	          print “Sum”
	Stop


# Algorithm to Find the Factorial of a Number

	Start
	Enter a positive integer number “Num”
	Check that User entered positive integer number, if not prompt them to try again.
	Declare “Variable”, “Factorial” and give the “Factorial” an initial value of 1.
	Initialize the loop
	    while “i” is less than or equal to “Num”
	           multiply “Factorial” by “i” and store result in Factorial 
	           add 1 to i
	End while loop
	print “Factorial”
	Stop


# Algorithm to Find the Fibonacci Sequence

	Start
	Declare the variable for numbers in the Series.
	Store the first variable, n0, as 0
	Store the second variable, n1, as 1
	Initialize the for loop
	Store the sum of first and second variable as “Sum”
	                 Sum=n0+n1
	                n0 becomes n1
	                n1 becomes “Sum”
	End loop
	print first variable
	print second variable
	Stop


# Algorithm to sort a given Set of Numbers (Bubble Sort)

	Start
	List the given set of numbers.
	Initiate the for loop
	Go through the list starting with the first number
	      if the first number is greater than the second number, swap positions.
	      Continue the same process for other numbers.
	End loop
	print list
	Stop


# Algorithm to convert a given number from one base to another

	Start
	Declare variables as “Number”, “Source base”, and “Target base”.
	If Source base is not base 10
	      Convert Number to Decimal Number
	      Divide Decimal Number by target base.
	      Store the remainder of the division.
	print remainders
	Stop
